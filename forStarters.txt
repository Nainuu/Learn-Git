Git - For Starters 

1. Make sure to create a repo on GitHub and copy the SSH and then use it in the line below (inside “”)
nainu@MacBookAir calculator-1p % git clone “git@github.com:Nainuu/Calculator1.git”
nainu@MacBookAir calculator-1p % cd Calculator1 

2. To add all the changes that you have done after you have modified, do
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git add *

3. To commit changes altering adding them, do
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git commit -m "added test file"

4. To check the difference between the code use this (OPTIONAL)
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git diff

5. To push the code to the GITHUB, you do
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git push 

Time to Learn  BRANCHING

1. To make changes and not to be disturbed by the other team working on it. We make branches by
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git checkout -b iphone_checking
** Switched to a new branch 'iphone_checking'
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git add .
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git commit -m "firstBranching"

2. Now it’ll not push it directly into the sub branch for that do this
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git push --set-upstream origin iphone_checking

3. After all the changes in the sub branch when you want to make these changes to master first move to main by
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git checkout main  
**Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

4. To check the git branch (OPTIONAL) you can see VS code left bottom or else use 
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git status

5. Now to merge the changes of sub branch in the main do this (use your sub branch name in it against iphone_checking)
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git merge iphone_checking

Now you can push again to get these changes on GitHub by .. git push
IT’LL WORK AS MERGE COMMAND automatically add and commit these changes and we just require to push

6. In case of git conflict. Like if master has some changes which the sub branch has also some changes hence conflict arises and then you need to see the changes and then delete what changes you don’t want including the extra lines generated by the git and then add, commit, push to get it to GitHub

7. Working with other people, they can make change and it won’t be seen in your file. For that first choose the branch and then do
nainu@MacBookAir Calculator1 % git pull
